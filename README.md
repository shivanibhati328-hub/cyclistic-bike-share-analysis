# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis (2025)

An end-to-end data analysis project using SQL and Tableau to generate business insights and support strategic membership conversion.

---

## Business Problem

Cyclistic is a bike-share company aiming to increase the number of annual memberships. While casual riders generate a significant portion of total trips, the company wants to better understand how their behavior differs from annual members.

The goal of this analysis is to identify key behavioral differences between casual and member riders and develop practical, data-driven strategies to encourage more casual riders to convert into long-term members.

---

## Objectives of the Analysis

- Compare ride behavior between casual riders and annual members  
- Analyze differences in ride duration, frequency, and usage patterns  
- Examine weekday trends and bike type preferences  
- Identify meaningful behavioral insights  
- Provide data-backed recommendations to support membership conversion  

---

## Tools Used

- SQL (Data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation)
- Tableau Public (Data visualization & dashboard creation)
- GitHub (Project documentation & version control)

## Project Workflow

1. Data Collection & Combination (Monthly trip datasets merged)
2. Data Cleaning & Validation
3. Feature Engineering (Ride Duration Calculation)
4. Data Aggregation for Visualization
5. Exploratory Data Analysis
6. Business Insights & Strategic Recommendations

## Dataset Overview

The analysis is based on **5,552,092 ride records** from the 2025 Cyclistic trip dataset.

**Key variables used:**

- Rider type (member vs casual)  
- Ride start and end timestamps  
- Bike type (electric vs classic)  
- Weekday usage patterns  

---

## Data Preparation

Several data preparation steps were performed before analysis:

- Checked and evaluated missing values (21% NULL station names were retained due to proportional distribution across rider types)  
- Created a new variable, `ride_length_minutes`, to calculate ride duration  
- Validated ride duration values to ensure no negative or unrealistic entries  
- Built aggregated summary tables to support efficient visualization

## Key Findings

### Ride Volume Distribution

Annual members account for approximately **3.55 million rides**, while casual riders account for about **2.00 million rides**.

Although members generate more total rides, casual riders still represent roughly **36% of total usage** — indicating strong engagement and meaningful conversion potential.

---

### Average Ride Duration

Casual riders average **22.63 minutes per trip**, while annual members average **12.42 minutes**.

This nearly twofold difference suggests that casual riders tend to take longer, experience-focused trips, whereas members are more likely using bikes for shorter, routine transportation.

---

### Ride Distribution by Day of Week

Members show relatively consistent ride activity throughout the week.

Casual riders demonstrate increased activity on weekends, indicating a more leisure-oriented usage pattern.

This weekend concentration presents an opportunity for targeted marketing campaigns.

---

### Bike Type Preference

Both rider groups show a strong preference for electric bikes.

- Casual riders: ~66% electric bike usage  
- Members: ~64% electric bike usage  

Electric bikes play a major role in overall rider experience, particularly for longer trips.

---

## Strategic Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following strategies are recommended:

- Promote membership as a cost-effective option for longer-duration riders  
- Launch weekend-focused upgrade campaigns targeting casual users  
- Offer member-exclusive electric bike incentives  
- Identify and target high-frequency casual riders with personalized savings messaging
